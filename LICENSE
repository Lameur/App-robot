# LibreShare Non-Commercial License (LSNC)

**Version 1.0**

**Copyright (c) 2025 - Lameur**

## Plain Language Summary

This license allows you to use, study, modify, and share our software for free, as long as you don’t use it to make money (commercial use is prohibited). You can use it in an educational context (school, university, training) if it remains non-commercial. You must share your modifications under this same license and include the source code. You cannot analyze or modify compiled versions of the software (e.g., executable files) without permission. We may change this license or stop sharing the software in the future, but your rights to versions you already have remain valid. For questions, contact us at [lameur.tech@gmail.com](mailto:lameur.tech@gmail.com).

## Preamble

The LibreShare Non-Commercial License ([LSNC v1.0](version/en/1.0.md)) governs the use, modification, and redistribution of the software to which it is attached. Designed for Lameur’s projects ([GitHub](https://github.com/Lameur)), it can be used by any person or entity in compliance with open-source principles and GitHub’s terms. It promotes the free sharing of source code while prohibiting commercial use and protecting compiled versions against reverse engineering, particularly to safeguard proprietary elements such as the non-open-source compiler of the Rights Holder. The Rights Holder may modify the license terms or cease public distribution for future versions. This license is governed by French law, as specified in Article 10.
